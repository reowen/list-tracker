list-tracker
============

This project is a web- and mobile- app for keeping, sharing, and organizing lists.  It began as a side project I started to help my family coordinate their Christmas lists to avoid double-gifting.

It is written in Python using webapp2 and jinja2, and uses Twitter's bootstrap CSS framework.

The production website can be found here:
